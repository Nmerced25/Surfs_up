# Overview
  The purpose of this assignment is to properly produce an analysis based on temperature trends in Hawaii. Moreover, to provide summary statistics 
  of temperatures within the months of June and December. These months were chosen in order to have an overall view for operating of the ice cream shop
  to either be seasonal or a year round business. 
  
# Analysis
  # June Data
  When it comes to the weather patterns for June it is shown below through the table that is provided:

 Furthermore, a graph was plotted in order to show a visualization of the temperature trends

 Also listed is the graph illustrating the same data and frequency:

  # Overall Differences
  -When comparing both months the data shows that there is about a 3 degree difference in average temperatures. This may not seem like a big change in both, however
  about 50% of the time in June the temp has shown to be about 75 degrees versus in December where the temperature shows to be at 71 degrees. 
  
  -In the month of December, the graph illustrates that the overall average temp is more consistent sitting at 74 degrees versus the frequencies in June that show almost 
  a curve where it can vary from low to high 70s.
  
  -Within the month of June even though temperatures may vary, the differences in the colder temps are a 12 degree difference which highlights the time of year and 
  can be a factor that plays into operating hours within the business.

 # Summary
  When comparing both moths, even though there are some changes that can be concerning, it would be a viable option to extend opertating hours passed the summer 
  months.
  This is in part with the fact that December averages are not far off from June. Even with the near 4 degree difference, the consistent temp within December can 
  provide ideal conditions for customers to visit the business. Even with the concerns of colder temps, there is a more consitent chance that those few days that may 
  occur can easily be made up.
 
  My second query with the data was focused on the stations and the temps that were recorded within both months. This allows for a more focused look into the specific 
  areas and provides detailed information.

  With this query it shows that ideally for the average beach goer, June temps show ideal beach conditions for the average beach consumer. When compared to December,
  even with the colder temps, surfers are more likley to be the dempgraphic that would be the most active. This comparison of consumers could also create the direction 
  that the shop would want to take in terms of marketing out.
